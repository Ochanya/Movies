// You have some practice with the movieDB API and using it and functional programming methods to log information to the console. You also have some practice putting elements into a web page with JavaScript. This weekend, you'll do those things together.
//
// Goal One
//
// Recreate something like the #main element of IMDB's current movies page, using the /movie/now_playing movieDB API endpoint as a source to identify the movies in theaters now.
//- Use given url to access data.
//- convert to json
//- search for reqired information on bd and see what steps will be reqiured to access the information
//  -Movie poster
//  -Movie title(year)
//  -Rating
//  -duration
//  -Genra/type of movie
//  -Metascore
//  -reviews
//  -Movie Description
//  -Director
//  -Stars-4 of them
//- Use Handlebars to display items
//  -go over Handlebars notes




//
// Goal Two
//
// In a second web page, recreate something like the #filmography section of an IMDB Filmography page.
//
// Goal Three
//
// Go nuts. There is a lot of interesting information in the database; come up with cool ways to display it. Use other IMDB pages as inspiration.
